# SMS-Spam-Ham-Detection

## Objective
- Develop an efficient machine learning model to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages (ham) in SMS communication, aiming to reduce the inconvenience and potential security risks caused by unsolicited and fraudulent messages. The model should achieve high accuracy and generalizability across diverse datasets while minimizing false positives and negatives, ultimately enhancing user experience and trust in SMS-based communication platforms.
